# Blockchain Challenge

This project was offered by Blockchain as a Front-end Engineer Code Challenge for Summer Interns 2019. This is a simple web application using React and the Blockchain API that loads and displays the balance and transactions for a bitcoin address someone searches, and updates itself when new transactions are made.

## Getting Started

Go to a folder where you want to clone this project locally and open the terminal in that folder (You will get an option if you right click inside the folder).
Clone this project on your local machine using this command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Debjitdj/blockchain_challenge.git
```

### Prerequisites

(If you already have Node.js and npm installed, you skip to 'Installing')

* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* Install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

### Installing React

Install react using this command:

```
npm install react
```

## Running the app locally

Now you can run the react app locally using this command:

```
npm start
```
This should automatically open your default browser with URL: http://localhost:3000/

## Instructions to use the App

You can search with any Bitcoin address and it will show you some information about that address, like:

* Total amount of Bitcoins received
* Total amount of Bitcoins sent
* Total number of transactions
* Current Balance

It will also give you a list of all transactions done by this Bitcoin address.

Here are some randomly selected addresses, for testing purposes:

* 1EzwoHtiXB4iFwedPr49iywjZn2nnekhoj
* 1dice8EMZmqKvrGE4Qc9bUFf9PX3xaYDp

You can see more details about the transactions if you click on them.
